# HistoryProject
A simple but stylish school-project based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main purpose is to simplify the process of preparation for history exam.

## The story
When finishing school in Belarus, one must take the history exam. However, the materials provided in school books are not enough to pass it with a decent mark. 
Together with my history teacher, we designed a platform for the students of our school to help in studying and preparingto the exam. 
The project is completely non-commercial and is absolutely free. The benefit for me was the experience I gained during the developement :)
